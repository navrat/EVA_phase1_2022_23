Dataset: MNIST 
Objective: digit classification
New target is:
- 99.4% (this must be consistently shown in your last few epochs, and not a one-time achievement)
- Less than or equal to 15 Epochs
- Less than 10000 Parameters (additional points for doing this in less than 8000 pts)
- Do this in exactly 3 steps (or more)
- Each File must have "target, result, analysis" TEXT block (either at the start or the end)


**Solution:**

_Code 1: Building the skeleton_

Target:
- Create a light skeleton

Results:
- Parameters: 16.3k
- Best Train Accuracy: 98.81 (till 15 epochs)
- Best Test Accuracy: 98.74 (@ epoch ; till 15 epochs)

Analysis:
- Decent model with almost no overfitting
- Model does not peak by 15 epochs needs more capacity
- No epochs touch 99+ accuracy so far.
