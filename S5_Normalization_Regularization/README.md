*Session 5 Assignment to cover the following:
Date: 29-Jan-2022*

# Leverage the 10k paramter code from S4 and build the following experiments:
Write a single model.py file that includes GN/LN/BN and takes an argument to decide which normalization to include.
Write a single notebook file to run all the 3 models above for 20 epochs each.

- Network with Group Normalization
- Network with Layer Normalization
- Network with L1 + BN

# Steps and calculations to perform the 3 normalizations techniques:

- Network with Group Normalization
- Network with Layer Normalization
- Network with L1 + BN


# Findings from each of the 3 normalization techniques:


# Graphs highlighting accuracy and loss evolution over 20 epochs per experiment (4 charts: test/validation X loss/accuracy: 3 experiments per chart):


# Misclassified-images per experiment ( 3 collections in total):

Find 10 misclassified images for each of the 3 models, and show them as a 5x2 image matrix in 3 separately annotated images
